# sample2-website-under-flask
This is the second sample for our python flask coding session. On this sample, we will try to have  2 different pages, first is the message.html and the other is the multiplication table simple website


## SET UP
### TO RUN THIS PROGRAM:

1. go to your cmd and then enter this command : 'pip install flask' in your directory
   #### note: if you are using an IDE, just go the the terminal and enter the command


## RUN

### TO RUN THIS PROGRAM:

1 You can just run it directly to your IDE or

2. Go to your cmd and enter the command: 'python main.py' make sure that you are in the right directory on when you save the main.py

#### OUTPUT OF THE PROGRAM:
* Serving Flask app 'main' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

## RUN

### TO SEE THE RUNNING OUTPUT IN THE BROWSER:

1. Click or paste the linke provided by your code -->  http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
 
2. you will be redirected on the on our first page where our first function located: The message.html



### Now that our code is running, you will notice on our code that we have another function which is to run the print-table.html. You need to extend your local host link with the '/table/<int:num>'

Here is the example : http://127.0.0.1:5000/table/6/
#### We are getting all the multiplication table of the number you included on our link








## ALL DONE

That's it, I hope this sample flask program will help you to have an idea on how python flask and basic functions of it works.
Keep on motivating yourself, keep on practicising, keep on learning. 

### See you around on my next sample projects, peace!!
